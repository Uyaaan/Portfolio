# Professional Statement
I am deeply passionate about cybersecurity and driven by a strong sense of justice, equality, and the importance of safeguarding information. With a solid foundation in software development and cybersecurity principles, I thrive on solving problems that enhance security and reduce risk. I value clear communication and teamwork, and I’m constantly learning—currently working toward expertise in Python automation, SQL, and a thorough understanding of the CISSP domains.

My interest in cybersecurity stems from personal experiences with online breaches, which ignited a desire to prevent similar incidents for others. I believe in proactively identifying and addressing threats before they cause harm. By aligning my technical strengths with values that prioritize protection and fairness, I aim to contribute meaningfully to the security goals of organizations and the communities they serve.
